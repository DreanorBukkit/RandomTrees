          <h3>Welcome to Random Trees</h3>

<p><a href="http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/random-trees/" title="RandomTrees">Random Trees</a> changes the outcome of every new tree you plant and grow to have a random block type. This could be absolutely anything from Cobweb, to Diamond Blocks, to TNT, to Lava, to Glowstone, to Enchantment Tables, to Glass... the list goes on! What could possibly sprout next?!</p>

<p>This plugin is a lot of fun, as players can have anticipation of what block could possibly sprout next and will even present an element of danger, as the block could be lava! They could even end up growing a money tree, with it's leaves being made of emerald blocks! Who knows what might come next?!</p>

<p>This is of course totally random, so the player has no way of selecting what block grows, and hence could be surprised at the result, and can't just grow 50 diamond block trees if you know what I mean.</p>
